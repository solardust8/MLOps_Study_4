# Task overview

I was assigned with a task to develop simple spam/ham message type predictor service using  any model for sequence classification trained on related data. Main objective was to practice with DevOps tools, including Git repostitory preparation, familiarizing with DVC to version control the data, developing a simple (the most basic) API to reach the model, and building the Docker container to wrap all things up. Also, it was important to provide this repository with simple CI/CD pipeline to automaticly control the assembly of distributive and building of the container in CI as well as running simple tests inside of the container in CD. 

## Data 

The dataset attached to the task was [SMS Spam Collection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset). As seen in `notebooks/data_investigation_and_prep.ipynb` dataset was severly imbalanced. So, in order to upsample the minor class `nlpaug` was used (see `notebooks/data_augmentation_and_model_finetuning.ipynb` for info on model finetuning with data augmentation, as well as for required dataset structure). 

To get the augmented dataset, use `dvc pull` inside of the repo root (**note**: dvc repo is stored in public Google Drive Folder, you will have to authenticate to pull the files).  


## Model

To classify spam/ham messages [DistilBert for Sequence Classification by Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/distilbert) was used. 

Author is aware that using a deep encoder model for such trivial task might be an overkill. Nevertheless, this was made intentionally for practicing with deep language models and later maintaining such in containers (installing and configuring **torch + transformers** in a container). 

## Requirements

Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Dockerfile

**IMPORTANT**: .safetensors files are not stored neither in Git LFS nor in DVC repo, but in [Google Drife weights folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1rabrFtLligrzg1MyzYHPqreOURJ5Pq1S?usp=sharing). Before building, consider manually downloading the safetensors files and placing them to `weigths/<model_name>` folders together with `config.json` files.

## Hadoop DFS

In this practice assignment **HDFS** plays a role of a log storage (no complex functionality tested, just learning to set up basic namenode/datanode in a single-node configuration to later write log file in).
In order to get HDFS running, you need to optionaly modify and then move `docker-compose(move to Hadoop).yml` file in the root of the repi to a `Hadoop/` [**submodule**](https://github.com/big-data-europe/docker-hadoop) directory and run `docker-compose up`.

**IMPORTANT**: check whether you have added any IP alias or you have a hostname `datanode` mapped to a desired IP in `hosts` file.

## Hashicorp Vault
In this practice assignment **Vault** serves a simple synthetic purpose: it stores `HDFS Host: HDFS Port` as secrets. 
In order to get the container with Vault server running:
1. Move to `vault/` directory and run `docker-compose up` with modifications necessary. Pay attention to the fact you first need to export `HVAC_TOKEN`, `SECRET1`(HDFS host), and `SECRET2`(HDFS port) evironment varibles on your host environment in order to pass HVAC root token to docker-compose as well as later use it in API for logging in.
2. Run `python put_secrets.py` in order to pass `SECRET1`(HDFS host), and `SECRET2`(HDFS port) to Vault (in order to acess them later in API)

## Primitive API

API utilizes FastAPI lib. Server is ran with `uvicorn src.run:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000`. See more at [FastAPI page](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/).

**Note** that before initializing service and it's methods:
1. Script creates Vault client to get HDFS host and port information from Vault (container we set up earlier, see above).
2. Script creates HDFS client and reaches the host specified by 2 part secret extracted from vault in order to write initial line in `service_log/log` file in **HDFS**. 

To get the result, you need to send a GET /predict request with json payload, containing `"text"` field with a list of prompts no longer that 256 tokens. See `sample_query.json` for an example.
